# Assembly_Contest_2
The assembly project I submitted for contest two in CSE3120

***I did not create the .bat file! It was provided by my instrutor and I edited the paths to work on my device. Please edit the .bat file as you need, so that compilation is successful.***

To Compile and Run:

1: Install Visual Studio Code 2022 and follow the guide set by Dr. Irvine at http://asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2022/index.htm

2: Edit the .bat file, so that the paths are correct for your system.

3: Run ```.\asm_CSE3120.bat Invader.asm```

4: run ```.\Invaders.exe```

You can now enjoy my Space Invaders clone!

Otherwise, You can be lazy and just play with the executable. Be sure that the boom.wav sound file is present in the same directory as the executable.
